# unity-hawk

First build this fork of BizHawk: https://github.com/plunderludics/bizhawk/tree/unity-hawk

then copy these directories from `BizHawk/output` into `Assets/BizHawk/` in this Unity project:
 - `dlls`
 - `gamedb`
 - `Firmware`

(if the gamedb is missing it seems to cause the code to freeze)
