soon:
 X headless mode for bizhawk
 X put bizhawk in packages dir
 X switch to mmap solution
 - test multiple cores simultaneously
 - hack bizhawk to get input queue over ipc
   - [hmm - can avoid this for now just by doing AcceptBackgroundInput in bizhawk config]
 - cleanup code (provide args and everything to bizhawk via cli)
 - update build scripts, test build
 - remove old code
 - bizhawk send audio over ipc
 - include bizhawk files in git / package release
 
later:
 - generic message passing (or rpc) interface (e.g. for calling api functions from unityhawk)
  - with the aim being to facilitate comms between bizhawk instances i guess
 - custom lua libs, etc
 - have a nice interface (for unityhawk users) to interact with the bizhawk apis (e.g. for pausing, restarting, changing memory, etc)
 
 - update BizHawk (to 2.9.1?)

minor:
 - notify unity (maybe crash) if/when emuhawk is closed
 - pause bizhawk when unity editor is paused [https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorApplication-pauseStateChanged.html]
