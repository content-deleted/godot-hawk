- controls
  X keyboard input
  - gamepad input?
  - make it easy to remap/configure controls (either in lua or in unity)

- lua scripting
 - more testing; test our existing samples
 - more graceful handling of unsupported library functions, currently spits out opaque error and halts the lua script - not sure best way to handle this one
 - support some of the stuff in UHMainFormApi - loading roms, pausing/unpausing, volume control, etc
 - would be nice to support the graphics lib too for drawing debug info etc
 - make it easier to add custom lua libraries from the Unity project (see LuaTestLibrary.cs)
  - or at least a generic way to get information from lua scripts into unity (message passing or function calling interface)

- have a nice interface (for unityhawk users) to interact with the bizhawk apis (e.g. for pausing, restarting, changing memory, etc)

- update BizHawk (to 2.9.1?)

X emulator audio
 X some kind of resampling solution (use Bizhawk's SoundOutputProvider?)
 - clean up code, it's a mess

- better way of setting the dll directory, to avoid hacky loading currently in UnityHawk.cs

- test more cores
 - Mupen64
  - Doesn't work due to some error with attaching the video plugin
 X NES
  X QuickNes
  X NesHawk
 X PS1 (Nymashock)
  X graphics broken
  X can't run multiple in parallel

- nice unity component corresponding to a sample (rom + savestate + lua + config) [?]

- make a UnityHawk namespace instead of using UH prefix

- make a unity package
- think a bit about usability
