- controls
  X keyboard input
  - gamepad input?
X fix weird colors
- lua scripting
- think about framerate (how to match target console framerate?)

- emulator audio
 - some kind of resampling solution (use Bizhawk's SoundOutputProvider?)

- better way of setting the dll directory, to avoid hacky loading currently in UnityHawk.cs

- test other cores
 - Mupen64
  - Doesn't work due to some error with attaching the video plugin
 - NES
  X QuickNes
  X NesHawk
 X PS1 (Nymashock)
  X graphics broken
  X can't run multiple in parallel

- nice unity component corresponding to a sample (rom + savestate + lua + config)
- find a way of bundling emulator dependencies that works in build

- clean up source filenames -> probably should be UHInputProvider.cs, etc

- make unitypackage
