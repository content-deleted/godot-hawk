- controls
  X keyboard input
  - gamepad input?
X fix weird colors

- lua scripting
 X [basic implementation works now]
 - more testing; test our existing samples
 - more graceful handling of unsupported library functions, currently spits out opaque error and halts the lua script - not sure best way to handle this one
 - support some of the stuff in UHMainFormApi - loading roms, pausing/unpausing, volume control, etc
 - would be nice to support the graphics lib too for drawing debug info etc
 - make it easier to add custom lua libraries from the Unity project (see LuaTestLibrary.cs)

- think about framerate (how to match target console framerate?)

- update BizHawk (to 2.9.1?)

X emulator audio
 X some kind of resampling solution (use Bizhawk's SoundOutputProvider?)

- better way of setting the dll directory, to avoid hacky loading currently in UnityHawk.cs

- test other cores
 - Mupen64
  - Doesn't work due to some error with attaching the video plugin
 - NES
  X QuickNes
  X NesHawk
 X PS1 (Nymashock)
  X graphics broken
  X can't run multiple in parallel

- nice unity component corresponding to a sample (rom + savestate + lua + config)
- find a way of bundling emulator dependencies that works in build

X clean up source filenames -> probably should be UHInputProvider.cs, etc

- make unitypackage
